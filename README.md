[Link to game] (https://dinethr8.github.io/project0/)

A web based interactive Tic Tac Toe experience.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML 
- CSS
- Javascript


## What it does

-   Tic tac toe can be played.

-   X will always go first.
X's or O's are added to the board using a function containing a for loop for the grid of cells which each contain an event listener. It listens for a 'click' anywhere on the 3x3 board - then, determines which box specifically was clicked. It then decide's the current player (X or O) before filling the box with the required character.

-   The program can determine the result of a game. The result is dynamically added below the game board after every game (X win, O win, or a draw).

-   A 'Restart' button is added below the game board. After the button is clicked, the board is reset and the result is removed from the screen.

## Design

- The design is kept simple and elegant with a target audience of all ages. 



*Please note the design will have regular updates*
